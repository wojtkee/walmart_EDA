I have decided to conduct an analysis based on data with missing markdown values that were not used during clustering. The data was divided into 3 clusters that best represented the clustering effects. The graphs show easily identifiable clusters of points visible on the plot. Subsequently, an analysis was conducted between stores across clusters and within clusters themselves. The following results can be observed:

Weekly sales vary significantly between stores within clusters, with the smallest variability observed in cluster 2, which also has the lowest weekly sales among all clusters. The greatest diversity, however, occurs within cluster 1. Cluster 0 shows more variability than cluster 2 but less than cluster 1.

In all clusters, significant temperature differences can be observed.

Cluster 2 is characterized by the highest number of unemployed individuals, with significant variation across individual stores, typically around a median of approximately 10 unemployed persons per store. Clusters 0 and 1 exhibit lower unemployment levels, but still show considerable variability depending on the store.

In cluster 2, the largest fluctuations in fuel prices are observed, typically ranging around 3 and 3.7. Clusters 0 and 1 show similar patterns in their graphs to cluster 2 but are shifted downward, particularly cluster 0, indicating lower fuel prices.
The CPI (Consumer Price Index) graphs show significant differences between regions in cluster 0, characterized by high CPI levels around 210. Cluster 1 exhibits a completely different pattern with large fluctuations ranging from 220 to 120. In cluster 2, CPI levels are generally lower.
